  Recent technological advances and manufacturing paradigm evolutions in industrial settings will dramatically increase the complexity of automation control systems. Traditional solutions to the software development of low-level control kernels (e.g., numerical control kernel, motion control kernel, and real-time communication tasks) are unable to cope effectively with such complexity due to an inadequate level of abstraction and challenges for dependability. This article presents a formal semantics integrated model-driven design approach as a holistic solution. A domain-specific modeling language (DSML) is specified based on the adaption of IEC 61 499 architecture, along with the extensions of task model, task-to-resource allocation, and nonfunctional specification. Both formal structural and behavioral semantics of the proposed DSML are then explicitly defined. Design-time formal verification is also achieved by automated model transformations. A metaprogrammable environment is adopted to facilitate flexible modeling, verification, and code generation. A case study is demonstrated on implementing a prototype computer numerical control (CNC) system using the proposed solution. Note to Practitionersâ€”The low-level automation control system in the modern manufacturing scenarios require more agility while respecting strict timing constraints. Handling such complexity with manual coding is getting harder and less efficient. The DSML and the supporting development environment presented in this article aim to enhance the level of automation, flexibility, and dependability of the whole design process. For the proposed DSML, its syntax is formalized and defined as metamodels, while the semantics is integrated through model annotation and transformation. These definitions are implemented as external rules for a metaprogrammable environment to establish our proposed development tool. The finding and insight from this article can enhance efficiency and dependability during the development of common control kernels, such as CNC kernel and motion controller.
